#### Add more unit tests to enhance quality assurance


- **Description:**

In Alexa skill unit testing, we pass a sample request to the AWS Lambda function and verify it's response with the expected response. There are already three testcases added for each intent which runs whenever a pull request is merged. So these unit tests are in test directory and can be used as a reference to create more of them.
